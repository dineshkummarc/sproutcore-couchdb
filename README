CouchDB server adaptor for SproutCore. 

NOTE!!: This framework will only work with SC 0.9, and not 1.0alpha. A new version is in the works.

Includes updated SC.Server, SC.RestServer, and SC.RailsServer implementations. -Lawrence Pit (with bug fixes buy geoffreyd)

These updated versions of the server code will most likely make it's way into SproutCore before 1.0

*NOTE*: Overrides built-in SproutCore implementations of SC.Server, SC.RestServer, and SC.RailsServer.

Usage:

  $ sc-install geoffreyd-couchdb
  
  Then edit sc-config:
  
    c[:required] = [:sproutcore, :'geoffreyd-couchdb']
    
  ...and restart sc-server.
