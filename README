CouchDB server adaptor for SproutCore. 

This is the branch that will work with the 1.0a of sproutcore.

It is a work in progress with currently only fetching of views, and creating/ updating of individual records working

Some things to make it work:

in your model, you should add these properties:

primaryKey:"_id",
couchDesign:"tasks",
couchView:"all_tasks"

To set the default view. (you will be able to over write these in a future version.)

in your core.js you'll want to set the store like this:

store: SC.Store.create().from(SC.CouchdbDataSource.create({database:"tasks"}))

Then you should be able to relax.
